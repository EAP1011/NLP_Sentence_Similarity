I have two suggestions for you: My answer to your question is \"Probably Not\". Start them as early as possible. The answer to both of your questions is yes. I\\'ll answer this question: This sound like a very bad idea. It depends on the meat and how it\\'s cut. It\\'s a good question. It\\'s much better to ask. Have you tried asking? You are making this too complicated. You have no need to do anything. There are two possible causes for this: It seems to work. You can buy it on ebay for $25 and up. There are two traditional ways to bend wood: My advice would be to try a variety of coffees that you can afford and find one you like. It is not a good idea. Can you do this? Take a look at this:  I\\'d say it depends on the ultimate outcome you want? Not much you can do besides: But it is not a good idea. I had a similar situation. I had this same problem. There is no quarantine period. I am not sure this question would have made much sense to the Romans themselves. No you are not. This is a big problem. This sounds a bit unusual. I think it depends very much on the area. I have had the same problem. No it is not. I think that the short  answer to your question is: No. I don\\'t think it makes much difference. There\\'s not that much that you can do with a sourdough starter. You have answered your own question. This is probably not a good idea but I will suggest it anyhow. I\\'d say it depends what conditions you have. You don\\'t have to do anything to season it. I have the same situation and have traveled extensively. I do not think it\\'s a good idea. You are right on the mark. So how should I do this? Does this answer your questions? It depends how you\\'re stating it. I\\'ve had this problem while working in a pubs.
